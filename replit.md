# Standalone CRM System for Tourist Agency

## Overview
This project is a standalone CRM web application for tourist agencies, centralizing lead, event, contact, and deal management. It streamlines the CRM workflow from lead capture to group organization and itinerary tracking, serving as a comprehensive platform for managing tourist agency operations with modules for lead management, event scheduling, customer relationship tracking, and group organization. The business vision is to provide a robust, all-in-one solution that enhances efficiency and customer engagement in the tourism sector.

## System Architecture

### CRM Workflow
The system employs a lead-first, deal-centric, and event-based CRM flow, progressing from lead capture and qualification, conversion to contacts and deals, event assignment, to detailed event and group management including participant tracking, payments, and itinerary organization.

### UI/UX Design
The frontend utilizes React, TypeScript, Wouter, TanStack Query, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS. It features a consistent design with Shadcn components, color-coded status indicators, responsive layouts, and accessibility. The application displays a brand logo that switches based on the theme (dark for light theme, white for dark theme) and uses darker text colors for readability.

### Backend Architecture
The backend is built with Express.js, TypeScript, and Drizzle ORM, interacting with a PostgreSQL database. It exposes RESTful APIs for all core CRM entities and uses Zod for data validation and a storage layer for database abstraction.

### Database Schema
A normalized PostgreSQL database schema underpins the system, featuring core CRM tables (`events`, `contacts`, `deals`, `leads`, `groups`), `leadTourists` for detailed individual tourist data within leads, `users` for authentication, and supporting tables for `cityVisits`, `leadStatusHistory`, `notifications`, `forms`, and `formSubmissions`.

### Key Features
-   **Events Module**: Manages tourist events with filtering, sorting, color-coded availability, and participant tracking, including a dynamic `EventSummary` page with inline editable itinerary details and Excel export. **Event Editing**: Features a comprehensive edit dialog accessed via pencil icon on event cards, allowing updates to all event details (name, country, cities, dates, price, participant limit, description, color). Form includes frontend validation for required fields, local timezone date handling to prevent timezone shift bugs, and guards against clearing required dates. Uses Pattern B dialog lifecycle where the dialog stays open on errors but closes after successful PATCH, preserving user form state for error recovery. Supports manual color tagging (red, blue, green, yellow, purple) for visual organization. **Enhanced Data Validation**: Implements comprehensive payload normalization and schema validation through `normalizeEventUpdatePayload()` helper that validates date formats (YYYY-MM-DD with regex + parse verification), coerces types (participantLimit to number, price to string for PostgreSQL numeric), and trims all string fields. Uses `updateEventSchema.safeParse()` to catch malformed payloads client-side with descriptive error messages before sending to API, protecting against timezone shifts, invalid date formats, and type mismatches from alternate callers. **Guide Assignment**: Allows assigning viewer-role users as guides for specific cities within tours via EditEventDialog. Features a "Назначение гидов" section with dropdown selectors for each city, storing assignments in `cityGuides` jsonb field as `{ "cityName": "userId" }` mappings. Users can assign or clear guides through dropdown ("Без гида" option uses sentinel value "__NONE__" to avoid SelectItem empty-string errors). Assigned guide names display in EventSummary city column headers below city names in smaller muted text ("Гид: {firstName} {lastName}"). Backend provides GET `/api/users/viewers` endpoint for fetching viewer-role users with sanitized data (password hashes excluded).
-   **Participant Tourist Editing**: EventSummary page features full tourist data editing directly from participant table via Edit button next to each participant name. Opens TouristDetailsDialog with bidirectional sync between leadTourists (canonical source) and contacts (denormalized) tables using transactional updates. Contacts table includes leadTouristId nullable FK linking to detailed tourist data. Backend provides GET/PATCH `/api/contacts/:id/details` endpoints with transaction-based storage methods (getContactDetails, updateContactDetails) ensuring atomic updates across both tables. Frontend uses shared tourist form configuration (client/src/lib/touristFormConfig.ts) with field descriptors providing consistent labels, placeholders, and test IDs across Leads and EventSummary forms. Dialog includes loading states, error handling for missing leadTouristId links, and Zod validation using updateLeadTouristSchema.partial(). Updates automatically refresh participant table through query invalidation. **Visual Tourist Type Indicators**: Participant table displays visual badges next to tourist names matching Leads card design: User icon for adults, Baby icon for children/infants, and Star icon for primary tourists. Each badge includes tooltips for clarity. Backend /api/events/:id/participants endpoint batches leadTourist data fetches to avoid N+1 queries, ensuring efficient loading of visual indicators.
-   **Leads Module**: Offers comprehensive lead management with dual table/Kanban views, lead-to-tourist data separation, detailed passport data for individual tourists via `leadTourists` table, and automatic creation of initial tourist entries. Features **automatic lead conversion**: when a tour is assigned to a lead (via the tour/event field), the system automatically creates contacts, deals, and family groups for all tourists without changing the lead status, allowing tourists to immediately appear as event participants while maintaining manual control over lead lifecycle. The manual "Convert" button has been removed in favor of this streamlined workflow. Features manual color tagging plus automatic color highlighting (green for won/converted, red for lost statuses, with manual colors taking precedence). Kanban view displays status-based badge colors: gray for new/contacted, exact #f4a825 (amber/gold) with white text for qualified, dark green for converted, red for lost - all meeting WCAG AA accessibility standards. Includes advanced filtering by status, source, client category, tour/event, and color (including "no color" option) with combined AND logic and visual color indicators in the filter UI. **Lead Postponement**: When dragging a lead to "Отложен" status in Kanban view or changing status via edit form, a dialog prompts for postponement date and reason (expensive, no response, competitor, changed mind). Form edits are preserved and merged with postponement data. The system automatically returns postponed leads to "Новый" status on the specified date, marking them with hasBeenContacted flag and displaying a "Лид из Отложенных" badge in both Kanban and Table views for tracking previously contacted leads. Server-side date conversion ensures proper handling of postponedUntil timestamps.
-   **Group Management**: Supports two types of groups: Families (shared hotel/transport/invoice) and Mini-groups (shared hotel only), with automatic family creation during lead conversion and manual mini-group creation.
-   **Notification System**: Provides automated in-app notifications for bookings, group capacity, upcoming events, and participant birthdays.
-   **Forms Module**: A comprehensive lead generation system with a form builder, public form pages, and submission tracking. It supports various field types, including a dynamic 'tour' field that links to available events, and automatically creates leads from submissions.
-   **Booking Module**: A public-facing tour reservation system allowing customers to view, filter, and book available tours. It includes real-time availability indicators, a booking form for customer details, and automatically creates leads from submissions, linking them to specific events.
-   **Color Indication System**: Allows manual tagging of events and leads with 5 colors (red, blue, green, yellow, purple) for visual organization and prioritization. Leads also feature automatic status-based highlighting (green for won/converted, red for lost), with manual colors always taking precedence over automatic colors. Color indicators appear on event cards, lead table rows, and Kanban cards for quick visual reference. ColorPicker features enhanced visual selection with ring outline and checkmark icon for improved clarity.
-   **Authentication & User Management**: Implements session-based authentication using Passport.js with bcrypt password hashing for secure corporate user access. Custom user schema includes username, password, firstName, lastName, position, and role (admin/manager/viewer) for role-based access control. Features include login page with react-hook-form validation, ProtectedRoute component for route guarding, Settings page with admin-only user management UI (create/edit/delete users), role badges, self-deletion prevention, and comprehensive error handling with success/error toasts. Security measures include session regeneration on login/logout, IP-based rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes), and complete password hash sanitization in API responses. **Viewer Role Access Restrictions**: Viewer-role users (guides) experience role-specific content filtering: (1) Navigation is limited to Events section only in sidebar, (2) Backend enforces requireAuth on all /api/events* endpoints with role-based filtering - viewers only see events where they are assigned as guides via cityGuides field, and within those events, only cities where they are assigned, (3) POST/PATCH/DELETE operations on events return 403 for viewers, (4) Root route redirects viewers to /events (admin/manager to /leads), with auth loading guard to prevent race conditions. E2E tested covering login flows, CRUD operations, role-based access, viewer content filtering, and session management.
-   **Technical Decisions**: Includes dynamic geography for event city tracking, a standalone system design (no external CRM integrations), backend-automated notification strategy, and a refined lead data separation architecture to distinguish contact information from individual tourist passport data. It also features a robust system for auto-creating initial tourist entries with transactional safety and comprehensive tourist data completeness indicators for visual data quality tracking.
